# Web Scraping Projects

Welcome to my Web Scraping Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of my personal projects related to web scraping using Python and the Selenium driver. Each project explores different aspects of web scraping, including data extraction and automation.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into separate folders, each representing a different web scraping project. Here's an overview of the project structure:

- `Blkom Scrapper`: This project involves scraping data from an anime website and building a simple website to display the collected information, you can find it here: http://abdallahox.pythonanywhere.com .
- `Serial Killers Wiki`: his dataset was scraped from several pages on Wikipedia, you can find it here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdullahsamiir/serial-killers-wiki .
